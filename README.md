# Personal Portfolio

The purpose of this project is to create a website which will be a personal portfolio to show case my skills as a developer.

## Description

The website will be live on the internet where anyone can access and view information about me as a developer. They will be able interact with the projects that I will be show casing on the website, and contact me if they wish.

## What did I learn

I learned how to use context API to provide global variable to the components and apply styles based on the value of the dark theme toggle. Along with context API, I created custom hook inside the context file so that it can be used to toggle the state change inside the context.

I used the built-in client side form validation for the contact page, and will use the netlify built-in form handling to handle emails send via contact page.

## Tech Stack

I have created this app using React v18, and will be using CSS to style the website.

## Available scripts

As this website was bootstrapped by ReactJS, these are the usual available scripts.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
