# Personal Portfolio

The purpose of this project is to create a website which will be a personal portfolio to show case my skills as a developer.

## Description

The website will be live on the internet where anyone can access and view information about me as a developer. They will be able interact with the projects that I will be show casing on the website, and contact me if they wish.

## What did I learn

I learned how to use context API to provide global variable to the components and apply styles based on the value of the dark theme toggle. Along with context API, I created custom hook inside the context file so that it can be used to toggle the state change inside the context.

I used the built-in client side form validation for the contact page, and will use the netlify built-in form handling to handle emails send via contact page.
